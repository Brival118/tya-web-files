                        <p>TYA is running a 5 day employability programme during November 2021.
                            The aim of the programme is to offer young people aged 15-18 who have suffered abuse or
                            at-risk who may need a little extra support in relation to employment and next steps.
                            Weâ€™ll explore themes such as becoming more self-aware,
                            What does it mean to be employable and what skills, qualities and attributes you need or need
                            to develop further, action planning and providing opportunities to meet employers and network.
                            We have seen this project be successful as some young people have gained employment from
                            employers who came to provide insight in their industries.</p>
